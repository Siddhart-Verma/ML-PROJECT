Here aare the steps to folow to run the code...

1-> upload Dataset into mongodb, database name-> project, collection-> future.
2-> use data_clean.py file to clean the data.
3-> use model.py to train the model "Randomforest".
4-> use index.html for webpage and blackboc.css for design.
5-> at last app.py which is backend file.

How to run?
1-> Store all the file in one folder and open in any code editor.
2-> run server in your computer (eg if u use mongodb serve then type mongod in cmd).
3-> if you use cmd the use cd "c:/path of folder" python filename.py this command use for data cleaning, model and app file but to run the project only run app.py file.
