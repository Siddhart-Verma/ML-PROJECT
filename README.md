First upload Dataset into mongodb, database name-> project, collection-> future.
then use data_clean.py file to clean the data.
then use model.py to train the model "Randomforest".
then use index.html for webpage and blackboc.css for design.
then at last app.py which is backend file.

How to run?
Store all the file in one folder and open in any code editor and then run server in your computer (eg if u use mongodb serve then type mongod in cmd).
if you use cmd the use cd "c:/path of folder" python filename.py this command use for data cleaning, model and app file but to run the project only run app.py file.
Thank you...
